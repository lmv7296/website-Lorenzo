      <h4>Span and P</h4>
      <p>
        In html you will come across a lot of tags most used are span and p but
        what is actually the difference well i will be explaining this to you.
        Span is a inline element and will use the width it needs so it will not
        take the complete with that is available.
        P is a block element and so if not changed in css it will be taking the
        complete space available on the width of the page

      <h4>Semantic HTML</h4>
      <p>
        In HTML we have semantic elements these can be used to define different
        parts of the web page for example you need to make a header you can use
        the tag "header" now the browser knows that this is a header and will
        use it in that manner. this will also help you make you're code easy to
        read and finding bugs is now also easier.

        style. these selectors can be grouped into the following categories
        based on the type of elements they can select.

      <p>
        A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a
        special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class
        :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over
        the button and this selected button can then be styled.

      <p>
        In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and
        layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every
        HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
        content. The image below illustrates the box model:
